Dear [Hiring Manager/Team],

I’m a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering specializing in ML systems, LLMs, and neuromorphic AI. I build efficient, hardware-aware models and production-grade pipelines that translate research into impact for users.

- Developed RMAAT (astrocyte-neuron interactions) for long-context tasks; IEEE TCDS (2025)
- Optimized transformer and vision models; Python/ PyTorch/ TensorFlow; deployment with Docker/ONNX
- Intel internship: AI-driven predictive frameworks for semiconductor processes (DSIMS/XRR/stress/TEM)

I’m interested in [team/product], where [specific problem/initiative] aligns with my work on long-context modeling, efficiency, and hardware-aware optimization. I can contribute to [NLP/CV/ML systems focus], bringing strong software fundamentals and experience bridging research and deployment.

I’d welcome a short conversation next week to discuss fit and can share a 1-page summary of my Intel ML work and RMAAT results.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Dear [Hiring Manager/Team],

As a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering, my research spans LLMs, computer vision, and neuromorphic AI with a focus on efficiency and deployment. I build systems that are both high-performing and resource-aware.

My work on the Recurrent Memory Augmented Astromorphic Transformer (RMAAT) incorporates astrocyte-neuron interactions to improve long-context performance; it is published in IEEE TCDS (2025). I have delivered transformer optimizations across NLP and vision tasks (summarization, sentiment, detection, segmentation) using Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and modern tooling (ONNX, Docker). I’m experienced with model compression (quantization, pruning) and throughput/latency tradeoffs for production.

I also bring hardware-aware perspective: neuromorphic computing (Loihi 2/Akida familiarity) and Intel internship experience, where I built predictive ML frameworks for manufacturing and collaborated across process/device teams using DSIMS, XRR, stress, and TEM datasets. This taught me rigorous experimentation, metric-driven iteration, and cross-functional communication.

I am particularly excited about [team/product], where challenges in [retrieval/efficiency/LLM systems/multimodal perception] align with my background. I can contribute to [specific initiatives], from research prototyping to robust deployed systems.

I’m available for a 20-minute call next week and can share code/pseudocode and a concise results brief.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Dear [Hiring Manager],

PhD candidate focused on spintronic and ferroelectric devices with hands-on nanofabrication and characterization, plus Intel manufacturing experience. I bridge device R&D with process integration and system impact.

- Spintronic memory arrays: MTJ fabrication, Hall effect characterization, reliability testing
- FeFET synaptic devices: multi-level conductance states; endurance/retention characterization
- Intel internship: thin film DOE, process window optimization; DSIMS/XRR/stress/TEM; AI-driven analysis

I’m drawn to [team/technology: DRAM/NAND/3D memory/packaging], particularly [specific challenge or initiative]. I can contribute to [device/process focus] with TCAD/COMSOL modeling, lab instrumentation (Keithley/Keysight), and cleanroom skills (e-beam, litho, PVD/CVD, etch).

I’m available to discuss how my research and Intel experience can support [team] goals. Happy to share a brief portfolio of device results.

Sincerely,

Dear [Hiring Manager],

I specialize in memory and emerging devices, combining cleanroom fabrication, comprehensive characterization, and process integration. My PhD research includes spintronic memory arrays (MTJ stacks with e-beam lithography and sputtering) and ferroelectric FeFET synaptic devices with multi-level conductance and endurance/retention studies. I complement hands-on R&D with modeling (TCAD Sentaurus, COMSOL) and device-circuit co-design.

At Intel, I executed DOE for thin film development, assessed integration feasibility, and built AI-driven analysis for process optimization using DSIMS, XRR, stress, and TEM data. This experience sharpened my statistical rigor and cross-functional communication across process/device teams.

I’m excited by [Company]’s work in [DRAM/NAND/3D integration/advanced packaging]. I can support [team] in [reliability, variability reduction, integration, characterization], bringing strong lab skills (Keithley/Keysight, magnetic probe station), cleanroom practices (lithography, PVD/CVD, etch), and data-driven analysis.

I’d welcome a conversation and can share a concise results dossier.

Dear [Hiring Manager],

I bring a process-development mindset grounded in device physics and validated by industry experience. During my Intel internship, I designed and executed DOE for exploratory thin film development, evaluated a first-of-its-kind integration tool, and contributed to process window optimization and feasibility assessments. I analyzed material properties and structures using DSIMS, XRR, stress measurements, and TEM image analysis, integrating results with SPC/JMP and machine learning.

My PhD complements this with modeling (TCAD Sentaurus, COMSOL), device-circuit co-design, and characterization expertise. I am comfortable in the fab and in data, switching between lab, analysis, and documentation to move programs forward.

I’m excited by [Company]’s investments in [node/process/module]. I can contribute to [integration/reliability/variability/process control] with disciplined experimentation and clear cross-team collaboration.

Happy to connect for 20 minutes and share a concise summary of DOE learnings and integration recommendations.

Sincerely,
