Dear Hiring Committee,

I am excited to apply for [Position Title] at [Company/Institution Name]. As a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at Pennsylvania State University, my research focuses on machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and large language models (LLMs). I combine innovative algorithm design with a strong foundation in hardware-software co-design to develop efficient, scalable AI systems.

My work includes optimizing transformer-based architectures for tasks like long-context handling and continual learning, with applications in text summarization, sentiment analysis, and vision tasks like object detection and image segmentation. Leveraging frameworks such as BERT, GPT, and Vision Transformers, I have developed solutions that balance performance and computational efficiency.

In addition to software expertise, I bring experience in hardware optimization, including neuromorphic computing and advanced memory technologies, enabling energy-efficient AI applications. My technical skills encompass Python, MATLAB, and C/C++, alongside deployment tools like Docker and TensorFlow Serving for scalable production models.

I am eager to contribute my expertise to your teamÂ , aligning with your mission to advance AI and machine learning. I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and make a meaningful impact.



Sincerely,
Md Zesun Ahmed Mia
PhD Candidate,
School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,
